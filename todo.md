Server TODOs:
- Set up Django models
- Set up Restful api endpoints using these models
- Set up social login (check out allauth)
- Set up access control on endpoints
- Set up production server (maybe staging server) and simple deploy process

Client TODOs:
- Set up application in a more modular way
- Use grunt, gulp, webpack to compile assets into static bundles
- Remove all of the <link>s and <script>s from index.html, and just import those bundles
- Set up sass or less compilation
